						Grandma's Kitchen- food so good, you'll swear it was your grandma in the kitchen! <br>
						The idea for "Grandma's Kitchen" came from a conversation around the dinner table between myself, my brother and other family  members. We had been talking about how good the food was, but there was one thing missing- Grandma's Mashed Potatos. 
						Sure we had the recipe, but we didn't have the time to really make it the way she did. One of my familiy members said how thankful she was to finally have a home cooked meal after travelling for work the past few months. 
						That is when the idea hit me, I wanted to start a restaurant people could feel good about eating at. Nothing pre-made, generic or bland just good, old fashioned cooking by chefs who care. In summer of 2018, we opened the first Grandma's Kitchen and our second location opened in April of 2019. 
						Our chefs are specially selected so your food always tastes fresh, flavorful and "just like grandma made it!"
